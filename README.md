## Vehicle Models Company

### Introduction
In an effort to optimize inventory management, enhance marketing effectiveness, and maximize customer acquisition strategies, Vehicle Models Company embarked on a comprehensive data analysis project. Utilizing our extensive sales records database, we sought to uncover insights that would enable us to better understand product performance, customer behavior, and investment returns on marketing efforts.

### Objectives
The project was guided by three primary objectives:

1. Determine which products we should order more of and which to order less of.
2. Tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors.
3. Assess potential expenditures for acquiring new customers.

### Analytical Approach

Our analysis involved multiple phases:

* **Product Analysis:** We calculated low stock rates and product performance to identify products that required restocking and those that were underperforming.
* **Customer Segmentation:** By examining purchase histories, we categorized customers into VIPs and less-engaged groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation:** We estimated the LTV to predict future profitability and inform our customer acquisition budget.

## Key Findings

* Product Demand and Supply: Certain high-demand products, notably the 1960 BSA Gold Star DBD34 and 1968 Ford Mustang, were frequently out of stock, suggesting a need for increased inventory levels.
* VIP vs. Less-Engaged Customers: VIP customers contributed significantly to profitability, whereas less-engaged customers presented an opportunity for growth through re-engagement strategies.
* Customer Acquisition: The analysis of new versus returning customers highlighted a dwindling number of new customers over time. Coupled with the LTV data, this underscored the necessity and feasibility of investing in new customer acquisition.

## Recommendations

* Inventory Management: Prioritize the restocking of high-demand, high-profit products to prevent potential revenue loss.
* Marketing Strategies: Implement loyalty programs for VIP customers and targeted campaigns for less-engaged customers to boost their activity and conversion.
* Customer Acquisition: Allocate a portion of expected revenue from new customers towards increasing marketing efforts, guided by the LTV to CAC ratio to ensure profitability.

# Conclusion

Through data-driven analysis, Vehicle Models Company has gained valuable insights into product management, customer engagement, and acquisition strategies. By continuing to leverage these insights, we can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and achieve sustained business growth. Future efforts will focus on refining these strategies through ongoing analysis and adapting to changing market conditions to maintain a competitive edge.
